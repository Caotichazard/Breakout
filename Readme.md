# A Simple Breakout Game

Hi, I'm a CS student and right now I'm delving into the world of gamedev.

My prior experience with gamedev is close to none, I have made a game with some friends for a gamejam:
https://gamejolt.com/games/cybermyth/374618
I made all the game logic and code for this game.After that jam I became more interested in gamedev and now I'm here, making my first solo game in my first git repository.


## The project
This game is as simple as it gets, just a basic breakout.

My goals:

    -Make the game playable;
    -Make a score system;
    -Make a menu;
    -Give it sounds and music;
    -Maybe more things just for practice;
    -Not related to the game:
        >Use and learn git;
        >Share my project;
