Hi, I'm a CS student from UFScar a brazillian university, and right now I'm delving into the world of gamedev.

My prior experience with gamedev is close to none, I have made a game with some friends for a gamejam:

I made all the game logic and code for this game.After that jam I became more interested in gamedev and now I'm here, making my first solo game in my first git repository.
